**How it works :**

Drop the batchfile on this script to obfuscate it.

The obfuscated batchfile will output to the location of this script, regardless of if you are using a shortcut or not.

It will also have three underscores appended to the name. For example CHINESE.BAT would become CHINESE___.BAT.
